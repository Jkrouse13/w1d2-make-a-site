        IndyCar is the premiere North American open-wheel racing series.  Founded in 1994 the series gained it's name due to the relation it has with the Indianapolis 500.  The Indianapolis 500, also called the Indy500, is the crown jewel of the schedule which typically boasts 16 to 20 races in a season.  Most races are contested by 18 to 20 drivers, however the Indy500 has a starting grid of 33.  Throughout the course of the 2016 IndyCar season 35 drivers from 12 different countries competed.
